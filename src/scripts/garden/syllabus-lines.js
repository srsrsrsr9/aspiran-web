// Every topic of the common papers, broken into the lines of UPSC's own syllabus (CSE notification), so the creeper
// (vine.js) can draw one leaf per line. Short forms of UPSC's wording; where UPSC gives one broad line (Prelims, CSAT,
// Essay), the parts it names. Optional and qualifying papers need none: their topics are already the leaves.
